## <a id="introduction"></a>🐇 Introduction

### What is a critical system?

> TL;DR Critical systems are built on trust - and trust is built on rock-solid engineering.

Critical systems are those whose failure can lead to injury 🤕, loss of life ☠️, environmental harm 🌱🚱, infrastructure damage 🏗️💥, or mission failure 🎯.

| **Application**                   | **Industry Vertical** | **Description**                       | **Failure Impact**                     |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Patient Monitoring**            | Healthcare            | Tracks vital signs                    | Failure can delay life-saving interventions |
| **Aircraft Navigation**           | Aerospace / Aviation  | Ensures safe flight paths             | Errors can lead to accidents                |
| **Power Grid Control**            | Energy                | Manages electricity distribution      | Failures can cause blackouts                |
| **Command & Control**             | Defence               | Coordinates military actions          | Failure risks national security             |
| **Industrial Automation Control** | Manufacturing         | Oversees production processes         | Malfunction can cause damage or injury      |
| **Core Banking System**           | Finance               | Handles transactions and account data | Downtime can affect financial operations    |

These are systems that **must** operate with high levels of safety, reliability and availability, often under *unclear* and *unpredictable* conditions.

These kind of systems we tend to forget about... until something goes horribly wrong 🫣

When the stakes are this high, conventional software engineering practices needs to be supplemented with rigorous verification, validation and certification processes that are designed to ensure the system's integrity.

In critical systems, there are no shortcuts - engineering rigour is everything.

### AI in Critical Systems

> TL;DR When failure costs lives, AI must be engineered like a scalpel, not a sledgehammer.

So, where does that leave us? **Is there room for AI in critical systems?**

Well, this isn't really a thought experiment as we're already far beyond the realm of hypotheticals.

From making life-or-death decisions in the ICU to controlling UAVs, doing surveillance and threat detection, and powering self-driving cars, intelligent systems are not just emerging in these areas, they are fully operational.

Building these systems is no walk in the park. ML brings powerful capabilities, but also adds layers of complexity and risk that need to be addressed through careful engineering.

While its ability to learn patterns and make data-driven decisions is unmatched in some domains, the adoption of AI in high-stakes environments must be tempered with caution, transparency, and a sharp understanding of its limitations.

Let's briefly recap some of the most important...

#### Models can and will make mistakes

<img src="assets/images/broken_dish.jpg" height="100px"  width="20%"/>

Better models may make fewer mistakes, but mistakes are generally *unavoidable*. These are not a sign of poor engineering, but an intrinsic feature of intelligence.

Unlike traditional software, which follows explicit rules, AI learns from data and generalises. 

Generalization allows models to make predictions beyond what they've seen so far, but it's ultimately imperfect because the real world is messy, ever-changing, and rarely fits nicely into learned patterns.

Working with AI means accepting this uncertainty and designing systems that can handle it gracefully.

#### Models often make mistakes that seem strange and unpredictable

<img src="assets/images/jackie_chan_confused.jpg" height="100px" width="20%"/>

AI doesn't always fail in ways that make sense to us. It might [misclassify a stop sign with a sticker as a speed limit sign](https://spectrum.ieee.org/slight-street-sign-modifications-can-fool-machine-learning-algorithms) or [switch treatment recommendations based on the user's language](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2486372-typos-and-slang-spur-ai-to-discourage-seeking-medical-care/).

<img src="assets/images/stop_signs.jpg" height="200px">

These aren't bugs in the traditional sense. These are artefacts of how the model interprets patterns.

While humans tend to make errors that are consistent with a rational view of the world, AI might say that a school bus is actually an ostrich, or classify a benign tumour as malignant.

<img src="assets/images/noisy_school_bus.png" height="200px">

These failures can be baffling and they demand robust monitoring and fallback strategies.

If not properly mitigated, they can render a system *useless*, or worse, **dangerous**.

#### Model outputs can be probabilistic

<img src="assets/images/determinism.jpg" height="100px" width="20%"/>

Traditional software is designed to behave the same way every time.

Same input, same output, *ceteris paribus*.

By contrast, AI systems can improve or degrade based on new data.

This means that today's behaviour might **not** match tomorrow's.

Notice that we're using **might** instead of **will**. This is an important point: just because models **can** act randomly and generate probabilistic outputs, it doesn't mean they **have** to.

While ML training can be **nondeterministic**, the resulting models are often **deterministic** during inference.

Given the same input, these models will consistently produce the same outputs... and make the same mistakes.

#### Data and models can change over time

<img src="assets/images/time_changes.jpg" height="100px" width="20%"/>

Data and models are not static things. They'll evolve continuously due to changes in the environment, user behavior, hardware, regulations and more.

Understanding and managing these changes is essential to maintain system safety, reliability, and performance.

Let's look at an example...

Imagine a supervised learning system trained to [detect early signs of pneumonia in chest X-rays](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia).

<img src="assets/images/chest_xray_pneumonia.png" width="200px"/>

Over time, several factors can cause both the data and the model to evolve:

* **Data Drift:** the original training data may come from a specific hospital using a particular X-ray machine. As the system is deployed in new hospitals with different imaging equipment, patient demographics, or scanning protocols, the visual characteristics and quality of the X-ray images may vary significantly. This shift in the input distribution without an accompanying change in the task can reduce the model's diagnostic accuracy. This kind of drift doesn't actually crash the model, it just makes it *quietly wrong*.

* **Concept Drift:** clinical knowledge and medical understanding can also evolve. For instance, new variants of respiratory diseases may present differently on X-rays, or diagnostic criteria for pneumonia may be updated. The relationship between image features and the correct diagnosis changes, requiring updates to the labeling process and model retraining.

* **Model Updates:** the model is periodically retrained with new data to improve diagnostic performance or reduce false positives. These updates might involve changes in architecture, training objectives, or preprocessing steps. While performance may improve on average, these changes can introduce new failure modes and even regressions in certain edge cases. Model changes must be managed and monitored carefully, with rigorous testing and rollback plans.

* **External Factors:** regulatory changes or clinical guidelines may require the model to provide additional outputs, such as severity scores or explainability maps. This requires collecting new types of annotations and modifying the model's output structure.

In safety-critical domains like medical imaging, the evolution of data and models is inevitable. As such, systems must be designed with this in mind, embedding mechanisms for monitoring, validation, and traceability at every stage.

> A model that performs well today may become unsafe tomorrow if changes go undetected or unmanaged.

By proactively addressing data and model drift, automating model updates and defining processes for dealing with external influences, teams can ensure that AI systems remain not only accurate but also trustworthy, transparent, and robust over time.

#### Perfection is a mirage

<img src="assets/images/mirage.jpg" height="100px" width="20%"/>

Achieving zero-error performance in AI is very expensive and, in many cases, **impossible**.

Instead, the goal should be to reduce risk to acceptable levels and build systems that can tolerate incorrect answers.

#### Always have a safety net

<img src="assets/images/safety_net.jpg" height="100px" width="20%"/>

When AI fails - and it will - the overall system must be able to recover.

This could be a human-in-the-loop, a rule-based override, or a safe fallback mode.

When it comes to critical systems, recovery is **never** an option.
